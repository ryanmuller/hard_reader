<h1>Advanced usage of Hard Reader</h1>

<p>There really isn't anything special to using Hard Reader itself, but there are countless ways you can use email to create your own experience. Let me know if you have other examples!</p>

<h2>Automatically send a link</h2>

<p>If you're already saving links to a bookmarking service or program like Evernote, you don't need to take an extra step to send it to Hard Reader. You can use <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to automatically send email to <a href="mailto:read@mg.learnstream.org">read@mg.learnstream.org</a>. Just make sure the email is sent from the address you used to sign up to Hard Reader.</p>

<h2>Multiple accounts</h2>

<p>Don't want all of your summaries to appear in the same review? Maybe you have one personal review and one you like to send to colleagues. All you need to do is sign up for multiple accounts on Hard Reader. You don't even need to create a bunch of email addresses: Some email providers, such as Gmail, will allow you to create any address for <code>you@example.com</code> in the form <code>you+whatever@example.com</code>. Follow <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/3598/is-there-any-way-to-send-an-email-from-a-gmail-plus-address">these instructions</a> to make these different addresses available in Gmail when sending to Hard Reader. That's all there is to it: any notes sent from a particular address will be grouped into its account.</p>

<h2>Read later</h2>

<p>If you're trying to keep your inbox clean, but you have too many Hard Reader notes to respond to, you can use <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/">Boomerang</a> to save them for another day.</p>
